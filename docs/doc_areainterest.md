This filter allows to limit the visualization on the map of the observations and the distributions for the chosen taxonomy to a specific area of interest (Region, Province, Habitat or SIC-ZPS-ZSC).

## Example

In the following case, the "Motacilla flava" species is shown only for "Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise ed aree limitrofe".
